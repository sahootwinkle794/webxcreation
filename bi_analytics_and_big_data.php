                            As a result of technology advancement that allows even very low level behaviors to be tracked online, every major business has mountains of data nowadays. However, few businesses know how to pinpoint opportunities in the mountains of data in multiple silos, and how to glean insight from every purchase, Tweet or customer care interaction. What separates winners from the pack is how much value they extract from that data.
