                        <h3>Transforming public services to achieve more for less</h3>
                        <p class="">
                            Governments and the public sector are undergoing transformational change. Increased pressure as a result of huge budgetary constraints demands radical changes to delivery models. Technology trends, demographics and economic conditions are all driving greater expectations from citizens and enterprises alike around access to data, state involvement in service provision and self-service.

                        <p>
                            The move to a digital economy brings further challenges. High priority must be given to security between government departments and between governments and citizens or enterprises for transferring and storing data. Within this landscape, unprecedented head-count reductions mean that fewer public servants are delivering more and more services, while new technology, such as mobility solutions, is a driving force for cost savings and efficiency that cannot be ignored.
